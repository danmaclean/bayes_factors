# Setting up

The primary purpose of this course is to help you to understand how to use statistics that will help with your research. The course will try to explain a branch of statistics called 'Estimation Statistics' which are complementary to the normal sort of hypothesis test procedures and address some of the criticisms of those methods.

Statistics is a computationally heavy topic, so we'll be making use of the R statistical programming environment to do that side of the work. The rest of this chapter will help you get that set up on your own computer.

## Prerequisites

### Knowledge prerequisites

There are no specific knowledge prerequisites for this book but it will be very helpful if you have read and worked through the `ggplot`, `Intro to Stats` and `Estimation Statistics` books and are familiar with R use.


### Software prerequisites

You need to install the following stuff for this book: 

 1. R
 2. RStudio
 3. Some R packages: `devtools`, `tidyverse` and `BayesFactor` and `simplebf`
 

## Installing R

Follow this link and install the right version for your operating system [https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/](https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/)

## Installing RStudio

Follow this link and install the right version for your operating system [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

## Installing R packages in RStudio

### Standard packages

In the RStudio console, type

`install.packages(c("tidyverse", "devtools", "BayesFactor"))`

and these packages should install. Once that is done, type 

`devtools::install_github("danmaclean/simplebf")`

to install the final package


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'tidyverse', 'BayesFactor'
), 'packages.bib')
```
